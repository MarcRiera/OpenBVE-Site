Almost two months after opening this site, it's now time to post the first RC of the new **1.5.0** stable series of builds.

*Note:* The current build has been updated to RC2, which fixes a critical bug with the Windows Installer package.

*Version 1.5.0.1*

**Significant Changes:**

* Graphical/ audio backend ported to openTK.
* Package Managment system added.
* Correctly moving bogies added.
* Various animation variables added.
* Large numbers of bugs fixed. (Probably some new ones too!)
* New in-game map & gradient profile.
* Timetable display options improved.
