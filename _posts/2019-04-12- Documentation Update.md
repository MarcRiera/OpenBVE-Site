Please note that the developer documentation has been significantly updated and improved.

The URL has changed as a result of this, and it may now be found at:

<https://openbve-project.net/documentation_hugo>

The site-menu has been updated to reflect this. The old documentation will remain online at it's current URL for the minute.

This has taken a lot of work, from contributors including S520, MidnightExpress1981 & Marc Riera- Thanks!

**Changes:**

* Rebuilt using the Hugo site generator, to allow for multi-lingual translation.
* Considerable formatting updates.


**Translations:**

If you'd like to see the documentation in your own language, we need your help!

Translations are managed through Transifex, and may be accessed here:
