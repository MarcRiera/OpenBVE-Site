*Version 1.6.0.1*
### Significant Changes:
OpenBVE v1.6.0.1 is a small hotfix for systems installing using the Debian package only.

Due to an oversight in packaging, **libmono-system-xml-linq4.0-cil** was not specified as a required system library, and OpenBVE subsequently crashed during loading.

If OpenBVE is working correctly, there is no need to do anything in this case.
