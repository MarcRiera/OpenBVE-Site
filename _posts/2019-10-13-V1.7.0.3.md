*Version 1.7.0.3*

Another small patch release (sorry!), updating one language file and the dependencies for the Debian package, solving an issue on systems which did not have **mono-complete** installed.

Please also note that this bumps the minimum Mono version required for Debian to 5.20- This is available in the current stable and newer by default.
Alternatively, Mono provide their own repository for all currently supported Debian / Ubuntu versions.

### Changes:
* Update zh-CN language- Thanks zbx1425!
* Update package dependancies for Debian.
