This is another relatively major release, primarily implementing the first version of a new openGL 3.1 renderer.

### Changes:

* New (optional) openGL 3.1 renderer.
* New: Improve the distance to next station display when the next station is not a stop.
* Fix: A train.dat file edited with Excel would not be recognised.
* Fix: Visibility broken for objects spanning more than one block in the reverse direction.

### Update:
Mac download temporarily rolled back to 1.7.0.3 due to issues with the openGL context.
Will push a fixed version as soon possible.
