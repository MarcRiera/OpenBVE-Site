The main highlight of this release is a plugin to support of a new set of Cab Controllers, contributed by Marc Riera.
These are those from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densha_de_Go!">Densha De Go!</a> series for Playstation, Dreamcast etc., connected via an appropriate PC Joystick adaptor.

The primary hosting for the release binaries has also changed to GitHub, but these & all older versions are still mirrored on the build server, along with the nightly builds.

### Significant Changes:
* New: Various **Densha De Go!** controllers are now supported via plugin.
* New: Add **AnnounceAll** and **DopplerAll** for adding sounds triggered by each car of a train.
* Change: Update OpenTK- Various improvements to joystick handling.
* Change: Joysticks are now identified via GUID in the controls file. This allows reconnection to work correctly.
* Change: Update pt-PT & zh-HK language files- Thanks!
* Fix: Crash if a negative switch sound index was supplied in sound.cfg
* Fix: Ambient and diffuse lighting colors swapped when using hex in a dynamic light XML
* Fix: Uninstalling a package with others that depended on it didn't show an appropriate error.
* Fix: Crash in a route with 3500+ sections
