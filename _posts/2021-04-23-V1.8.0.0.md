This release sees OpenBVE moving to 64-bit by default.
On Windows, legacy plugins are now run via a WCF proxy application. Alternatively, you can use the 32-bit **OpenBve-32.exe** which uses the original in-process plugin handling.

Unfortunately, 64-bit support on Apple is not yet functional. This is because the main menu is a WinForm, which is currently not supported on x64 Apple.
Work is in progress on producing a limited OpenGL menu here: https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/pull/595 and we hope to have a functional (but not pretty) version available *soon*.


### Significant Changes:
* New: OpenBVE is now 64-bit native by default.
* New: Add controls menu icons for generic gamepad and Xbox pad.
* Fix: Issue with trains containing a missing flange index.
* Fix: Invalid animated files getting locked by Object Viewer.
* Fix: Crash in Object Viewer if reloading after changing non-plugin loaded train properties.
* Fix: A negative timetable delta was broken with BVETS Hacks enabled.
* Fix: Cursor missing if menu opened with it hidden.
