This build fixes a few more odd issues that have been reported over the last few days after the move to 64-bit.

### Signifiant Changes:
* Change: Add **Brightness** function for train based animated objects.
* Fix: Issue launching the 64-bit build on Windows systems lacking the Creative OpenAL redistributable.
* Fix: Using a command string in a CSV object texture name could get misinterpreted.
* Fix: Crash on selecting a touch element with a missing sound.
* Fix: Several issues with TFOs in unexpected circumstances.
