### Experimental:

There were issues with the new renderer in 1.7.1.0, which meant that Mac support was unfortunately accidentally broken.
I *believe* this version to have fixed the issues, but until this is confirmed it'll be labelled experimental :)

# Nightly Builds:

Nightly builds are available from this address:

These provide a daily snapshot, which is automatically built from the current source whenever a change is made.
Whilst they are generally stable, it's important to remember that sometimes things may not work quite right. 

If this is the case, please let us know by posting on the forum or opening an issue on GitHub, and we'll try and get to the bottom of it.
