# Playing OpenBVE: Cab Controllers

---

Several companies produce desktop cab controllers for playing train simulators. 
Where possible, OpenBVE will attempt to support these.

A list of the currently supported cab controllers and links may be found below:


## The RailDriver from PI Engineering

This will be recognised as a standard Joystick, but may require calibration for all axis to work correctly.
Calibration may be performed under the Options menu.

## OHC-PC01 from SanYing Heavy Industries

This is a custom joystick, and requires the SanYingInput plugin to be activated and configured under the Options menu to work correctly.
