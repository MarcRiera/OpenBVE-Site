## Version 1.5

Version 1.5 is currently under development.

### Implemented Features:

* Added animated bogies to train cars. (This was previously possible with various physics based hacks, but not officially supported)
* Extend a range of variables available via the plugin interface & animated files.
* Port backend libraries to openTK.
* In-game menu and information displays re-written.
* Animated objects may now follow the path of Track 0.

### Work In Progress Features:

* Package management: Allow developers to create a managed package format, providing an easy installation and metadata for routes and trains.

## Version 1.6

### Planned Features:

* Deprecate the train.dat and extensions.cfg files, in favour of an XML based system allowing much greater flexibility.
* Multiple views (Cab, passenger etc.) available per train.
* Backport the openBVE 2 demo object parser plugin interface.

## Version 1.7

### Planned Features:

* Further extend the XML configuration of trains, to allow the creation of custom 'consists'
